# SASS-PixelArt-Pack
Collection of some of my scss scripts (SASS), excellent as examples to understand how Pixel Art works in scss ... You will find a preset grid with dozens of colors in hexadecimal that you can use to create any type of work in 8bit style, and some examples from which you can take inspiration.
